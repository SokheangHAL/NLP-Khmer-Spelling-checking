ex: amazing : អាមេហ្សីង

2/ word that borrow the word from the other lannguage.(word that loan officially)​(some word has the writting word and some of them not just use for daily)[came from the colony -french-enlish]
ex: garage : ការាស(យាន្តដ្ឋាន)
video : វីដេអូ

3/ word that write it wrong on the khmer language(seq, vow, cons, )

4/ word that create at 21 centry for cmt on the facebook...(short word but has thier meaning)
ex : loy- ឡូយ,  emm - អេម,​ អែម
-the word that write from the spoken language

5/ unicode error(not the error but it the format to write them// it could be in typo_error)

for example : 	ប៉ិន --- ប + ៉ + ិ + ន		[expertise]	(in Notepad, Dic Chhounnath) # in telegram (ប+ុ+ិ+ន)
